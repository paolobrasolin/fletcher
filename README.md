This project is a sourcecode transpiler for commutative diagrams.

The aim is being able to translate *from and to* any of the following formats:

* [quiver][quiver-url] internal representation (crucial: the best editor)
* [DOT][dot-url] graph description language (simple grammar)
* [CoDi][codi-url] based TikZ picture (crucial: mine!)
* [tikz-cd][codi-url] based TikZ picture (crucial: gaining traction)
* [xymatrix][xymatrix-url] based XY-pic picture (to save people)
* [amscd][amscd-url] figure (to save people)
* [other][other-url] LaTeX packages
* ...
